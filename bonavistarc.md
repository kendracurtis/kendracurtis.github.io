# Lake Bonavista Restrictive Covenant (RC) Initiative

---

**As a result of the recently passed [Blanket R-CG Rezoning](https://www.calgary.ca/planning/projects/rezoning-for-housing.html) are you concerned about what could be
built beside you?** 

Some Lake Bonavista community members have retained legal counsel [Carbert Waite LLP](https://carbertwaite.com/)and have started a Restrictive Covenant initiative to help maintain the nature of our community --- ***single-family homes, big trees, quiet/safe streets, ...*** --- An RC is the only legal option for keeping our neighbourhood the way it is today.

## What is R-CG Zoning?

Residential Contextual Grade Oriented (R-CG) allows for (i) single detached, (ii) semi-detached, (iii)
townhouse, (iv) row house or (v) fourplex
* Height: 11 metres /36 feet
* Density: 75 units/hectare
* Parking: 0.5 stalls/unit

More Information R-CG zoning:
* [City of Calgary Re-Zoning website](https://www.calgary.ca/planning/projects/rezoning-for-housing.html)
* [City of Calgary R-CG pamphlet](https://www.calgary.ca/content/dam/www/pda/pd/publishingimages/current-projects/R-CG-residential-grade-oriented.pdf)


## What is a Restrictive Covenant?

* Legally binding agreement that limits the actions of a property owner
* Purpose is to maintain value and character of a property or neighbourhood
  * In our case, the focus of the RC is to prevent subdividing properties and changing the
character of lots from single-family homes to multi-family units
* A “property right” which supersedes a land use bylaw
* Other Calgary communities also pursuing this option include: Rideau-Roxboro, Kelvin Grove,
Chinook Park, Eagle Ridge, Elbow Park, Mayfair-Bel-Aire

  * 50% for defence fund (held in trust) for potential challenges by developers
