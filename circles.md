## PEER MENTORING CIRCLES
<p style="margin:30px 0;" align="center">
Good mentoring and advice can be difficult to find. It can be especially hard to find a mentor who may have faced the same challenges. As I have progressed in my career, I have benefited from some great mentors and peer groups, but none have included a women. I have 20+ years of experience in software development. Therefore, I have started facilitating Peer Mentoring Circles including Circles specifically for Women in Technology. They are called Circles as they are Circles of Trust.</p>

### WHY JOIN

 <h4 align="center">Answers</h4>
 <p align="center">Your team, colleagues, and family are not necessarily going to give unbiased answers. This forum is a safe space to discuss your most pressing issues. These are small curated groups where members have likely been there and can provide answers.</p> <p align="center">Monthly Circles have an in-person facilitator and agenda.</p>

<h4 align="center">Connections</h4>
<p align="center">Circles meet for 3hrs on a monthly basis and will have a continuing on-line community. Each month members of the circle bring their most pressing issue for their peers to provide advice. </p>
<p align="center">Social distancing does not mean social disconnection. This is a way to continue to connect and interact during COVID-19.</p>
