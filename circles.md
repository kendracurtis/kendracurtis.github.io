Good Mentoring can be difficult to find. It can be especially hard to find a mentor who may have faced the same challenges. As I have progressed in my career I have benefits form some great mentors and peer groups, neither of which ever included a women. Therefore I have started Facilitating a Peer Mentoring Circles for Women in Technology. I am calling them Circles as they are Circles of Trust.</p>

### WHY JOIN

 <h4 align="center">Answers</h4>
 <p align="center">Your team, colleagues, family are not necessarily going to give unbiased answers.  This is a safe space to discuss you most pressing issues. These are small curated groups where you can discuss your most difficult questions. These are people who have likely been there and can likely answer your questions.</p> <p align="center">Monthly Circles have an in-person facilitator and agenda.</p>

<h4 align="center">Connections</h4>
<p align="center">Circles meet for 3-4 hrs on a monthly basis and have an on-line community. Each month members of the circle bring their most pressing issue for their peers to provide advice. </p>
<p align="center">Social distancing does not mean social disconnection. This is a way to continue to connect and avoid being disconnected during COVID-19.</p>
